# Analyzing-A-B-Test-Results
Applying practical statistics to conduct an A/B test

**For this project, I will be working on the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.** 

**The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if:**
* They should implement this new page
* They should rather Keep the old page
* They should perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
